# Cannot fetch new skins

If, by running `/sr status` you get the following red message:

`> Plugin currently can't fetch new skins. You might check out our Discord at ...`

Then this means your server cannot connect to the APIs the plugin requires to work.

## How to fix it?

This is a good question, and you are the right place to get an answer.
Our plugin needs the following domains at the following ports to be fully reachable:

| URL                        | Port  |
|----------------------------|-------|
| `api.ashcon.app`           | `443` |
| `api.mojang.com`           | `443` |
| `sessionserver.mojang.com` | `443` |
| `api.mineskin.org`         | `443` |
| `api.minetools.eu`         | `443` |
| `bytebin.lucko.me`         | `443` |
| `api.github.com`           | `443` |

If you are using a firewall, you need to open these ports on those domains to allow the plugin to connect to these APIs.
You also need to make sure that the port `53` of your DNS server you are using is reachable and working.
