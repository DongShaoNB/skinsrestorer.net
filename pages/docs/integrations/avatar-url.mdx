# Avatar URL

Do you want to show a player's head in, for example, a Discord message sent by a plugin? This is possible with SkinsRestorer!

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    We also have a guide specifically [for DiscordSRV](/docs/integrations/discordsrv)
</Callout>

## Prepare your server

Ensure both SkinsRestorer and PlaceholderAPI are installed on your server and are working correctly.

Make sure the plugin supports using PlaceholderAPI placeholders in the place where you want to use the avatar URL.

## Configure the plugin

Find the place where you can put a URL in the plugin. This is usually a config file or a message file.
Put the following text in the place where you want the avatar URL to be used:

`https://mc-heads.net/avatar/%skinsrestorer_texture_id_or_steve%.png`

Now reload the plugin and you're done! 🎉
