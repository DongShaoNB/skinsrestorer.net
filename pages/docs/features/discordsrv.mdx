# DiscordSRV

SkinsRestorer skins can be used for DiscordSRV messages using the PlaceholderAPI integration.

## Prepare your server

Ensure both SkinsRestorer and PlaceholderAPI are installed on your server and are working correctly.

## Configure DiscordSRV

Open your DiscordSRV config.yml and search for the `Embed & webhook image/avatar url format` section.
The config key is called `AvatarUrl` and is by default set to `https://crafatar.com/avatars/{uuid-nodashes}.png?size={size}&overlay#{texture}`.

Replace the default value with the following:

```yaml
AvatarUrl: https://mc-heads.net/avatar/%skinsrestorer_texture_id_or_steve%.png
```
