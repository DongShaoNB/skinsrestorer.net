# Skin URL

## Confirm a valid skin

Make sure the URL points to only the valid skin PNG file.
If you are using imgur, make sure that the url ends with `.png`.
A valid skin url should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/QuoWt6B.png

You can see the image below as reference:

## Uploading to imgur

This time we are going to upload your custom skin format to imgur. Follow the following steps:

<Steps>
    ### Download the file

    ![Image in download folder](/assets/imgur/download-folder.png)

    ### Go to https://imgur.com/upload

    Upload the file to **imgur** (see image below)

    ![](/assets/imgur/upload-image.png)

    ### Getting the url

    The Skin URL MUST END WITH .PNG, so make sure that you have the right url!

    Below you can see the skin I just uploaded to imgur, now right-click on the image and hit "Copy image url"

    It should copy an url like `https://i.imgur.com/abcdefgh.png`

    ![](/assets/imgur/copy-link.png)

    That's it! you can now set the skin by using your **IMGUR** url!
