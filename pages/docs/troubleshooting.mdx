# Troubleshooting

SkinsRestorer may sometimes have issues working properly. On this page, you can find some common issues and how to fix them.

## Basic Troubleshoot

First good steps to make sure you did everything right.

### Basic Spigot Troubleshooting

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Kindly check these steps below before asking for support on discord!
</Callout>

1. Check
the [Basic Installation](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/wiki/Installing-SkinsRestorer#basic-installation)
steps and see if they're the same for your server

2. Remove your ./plugins/SkinsRestorer/plugin.yml & Messages.yml files

3. Update the plugin if needed! [(SpigotMC)](https://spigotmc.org/resources/2124/)

4. Restart the server and see if this resolved your issue

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Still having issues?
    If you are a Basic server owner, you can ask for support on our [Discord](https://skinsrestorer.net/discord).
    For Advanced owners, feel free to check [Advanced Troubleshoot](#Advanced-Troubleshoot) for what else you can
    troubleshoot.
</Callout>

### Basic BungeeCord Troubleshooting

1. Check
the [Basic Installation](/docs/installation/bungeecord)
steps and see if they're the same for your server

2. If you *did configure spigot* than *remove the SkinsRestorer config.yml*
[SkinsRestorer should never make a config on spigot, if it does your spigot is not set to bungee mode!!]

3. Update the plugin if needed on BungeeCord [(SpigotMC)](https://spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/)

4. restart the server and see if this resolved your issue

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Still having issues?
    If you are a Basic server owner, you can ask for support on our [Discord](https://skinsrestorer.net/discord).
    For Advanced owners, feel free to check [Advanced Troubleshoot](#Advanced-Troubleshoot) for what else you can
    troubleshoot.
</Callout>

## Advanced Troubleshoot

For advanced troubleshooting, you need to have access to your server files and know how to use them.

### Commands not working

If commands aren't working, you need to make sure that you did follow our specific installation instructions. If it
still doesn't work, try removing the config and messages and restart your proxy, and if you don't have a proxy, your Spigot/Sponge server.

### Plugin incompatibility

Some not-well-coded plugins or plugins that modify the user profile mightn't work well with SkinsRestorer.
You can see this when you, for example, change a skin, and you see the chunks reload, but your skin just won't apply.

*List of known incompatibilities:*

- MundoSK
- Scripting plugins in general
- some mods

To figure out if it is a plugin incompatibility,
the best thing to do is running your server with SkinsRestorer as the only plugin
and see if it then works.
If so, you can try adding plugins and check each time if the plugin still works.
This way you can identify the plugin that might cause the issue.

### Server Incompatibility

We do not work on some Paper forks as well as some BungeeCord forks because they break the platforms API somehow.
We have only limited support for forge servers because they are usually breaking things as well.
Very commonly issues happen with:

- Aegis
- FlameCord
- Magma
- Mohist
- SpongeForge
- Cardboard

We want to support these platforms, but we can't do it alone if you are a developer and want to help us,
feel free to open a PR on our GitHub.

## Connection

*SkinsRestorer needs connection to download skin data, you can test your current connection using `/sr status`*

How are you hosting your server?
[ [Local](#resolve-local-firewall) / [Minecraft server hosting (panel)](#resolve-mc-provider-firewall) / [VPS & Dedicated server hosting (root access)](#resolve-dedi-server-firewall) ]
***

### Resolve Local Firewall

#### Resolve Local Firewall Linux

#### Resolve Local Firewall Windows

### Resolve MC Provider Firewall

When you only have access to a panel like multicraft or cpanel, you aren't able to change firewall settings.

If you do have access to ssh / root command line, go to -> [Dedicated server](#resolve-dedicated-server-firewall)

Use the below template to create a ticket / send @ to your Minecraft hosting provider

```text
Firewall issues - this is a email template copied from github:SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX

Dear Mc-Service provider,

I believe that your firewall setup is restricting one of my plugins to work properly, namely, SkinsRestorer.
In order to allow it to function properly, I need to be able to open new outgoing connections to specific HTTP API services.
You can see the list of required traffic at: https://skinsrestorer.net/docs/troubleshooting#firewall-pass-through-requirements

I kindly request that you permit such traffic for all Minecraft hosting services associated with my account.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact SkinsRestorer's team via:
Discord - https://skinsrestorer.net/discord
Email - support@skinsrestorer.net

Kind regards.
```

### Resolve dedicated server Firewall

The following script should allow new and established connections.

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1  -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED     -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED     -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo update-ca-certificates -f
sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/ca-certificates-java.postinst configure
```

Or you can see [Firewall pass through requirements](#firewall-pass-through-requirements) to manually allow api.

### Firewall pass through requirements

> All the required rules are **outgoing**, the only incoming traffic that should be accepted is the one from already
> established connections. Your server must be able to connect to the other networks. SkinsRestorer doesn't** require
> any incoming traffic from new connections to be accepted.
