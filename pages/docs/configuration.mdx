# Configuration

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚧">
    This page has outdated information and will be updated soon.
</Callout>

The plugin should be able to run without extra configuration needed,
but if you need to change the plugin behavior, you're in the right place here.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    After changing the configuration, you need to either reload the plugin with the command `/sr reload` or restart the
    server.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you run a proxy network (BungeeCord/Velocity), you need to have the exact same `config.yml` file on the proxy and
    all servers.
    If you make a change to the config on the proxy, you need to make the same change on all servers.
    Make sure to reload the plugin on the proxy and all servers after changing the configuration.
    The `/sr reload` command is only available on the proxy (Because all backend servers are in Proxy Mode),
    you'll need to restart the servers to use the new config.

## Who can change skins?

With SkinsRestorer, players have the ability to use `/skin <skin>` to change there look. Who should be able to do this?

[Everyone](#everyone) / [Special rank](#special-ranks) / [No one](#no-one)

***

### Everyone:

If you wish to allow all your players to change their skin, you aren't required to change the configuration. Just make sure
that `SkinWithoutPerm` in your SkinsRestorer configuration is set to `true`.

You can go to the [Next Step](#default-skins)

### Special ranks:

If you want a special rank for only players to be allowed to change skins, here is what you need to do:

Step **1**: go to SkinsRestorer config.yml and set `SkinWithoutPerm: false`

Step **2**: Give the desired rank the permissions:

**[!]** If you're using BungeeCord/Velocity, set permissions on BungeeCord/Velocity side **[!]**

To start off, you need to give the players the main command permission **skinsrestorer.command**, this is to perform
/skin.

Now you can start giving individual permissions, for the full permissions list
see [[cmds & perms](/docs/configuration/commands-permissions)] on our docs.

| Command             | Permissions                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `/skin`             | `skinsrestorer.command`         |
| `/skin <skin name>` | `skinsrestorer.command.set`     |
| `/skin <URL>`       | `skinsrestorer.command.set.url` |
| `/skins`            | `skinsrestorer.command.gui`     |
| `/skin clear`       | `skinsrestorer.command.clear`   |
| `/skin update`      | `skinsrestorer.command.update`  |

Step **3**: Restart your server (if BungeeCord, restart BungeeCord only)

That's it! When adding players to the special rank, they should be able to perform those commands. You can now go to
the [Next Step](#default-skins)

### No one

If you don't want your players to be able to perform commands, you can simply disable the permissions on default:

go to SkinsRestorer config.yml and set `SkinWithoutPerm: false`

Now make sure to **restart your server **

That's it! You can now go to the [Next Step](#default-skins)

## Default skins

Do You hate it when your server fill's up with Steve / Alex skins?
Or do you want all your players to have the same skin?

[ [No Defaultskins](#dont-want-default-defined-skins) / [Only when no skin](#only-when-they-have-no-skin) / [Everyone](#all-players)]

***

### Don't want default-defined skins

Oh, that's sad to hear, you can go to the [wip]

### Only when they have no skin

With Default skins, you can select the option to not set a default skin for players with a premium name. Here are the
following steps:

Step **1**: go to SkinsRestorer config.yml and set the following configuration:

```yml
DefaultSkins:
  Enabled: true
  ApplyForPremium: false
```

Step **2**: Define the default skins. You can set multiple default skins, sadly custom skins from SkinFileGenerator will
not work (is worked on). The default skins will be given out randomly if you did fill in more than 1 skin. You can do this
as followed:

```yml
DefaultSkins:
  Enabled: true
  ApplyForPremium: false
  Names:
    - Skin1
    - Skin2
    - Skin3
```

Step **3**: Save the config & restart your server.

### All players

*Same as above but now we turn *`ApplyForPremium: true`* so:*

Step **1**: go to SkinsRestorer config.yml and set the following configuration:

```yml
DefaultSkins:
  Enabled: true
  ApplyForPremium: true
```

Step **2**: Define the default skins. You can set multiple default skins, sadly custom skins from SkinFileGenerator will
not work (is worked on). The default skins will be given out randomly if you did fill in more than 1 skin. you can do this
as followed:

```yml
DefaultSkins:
  Enabled: true
  ApplyForPremium: true
  Names:
    - Skin1
    - Skin2
    - Skin3
```

Step **3**: Save the config & restart your server.

## Which skin can players set?

[ [Custom skins](#custom-skins) / [All skins](#all-skins) / [Disallow some skins](#disallow-some-skins) / [Only there own skin](#only-their-own-skin) / [NO SKIN](#NO-SKIN) ]

***

### Custom skins

To allow players to use the `/skin <URL.png>`, you need to give the players the
permissions `skinsrestorer.command.set.url`.

Make sure they also have permission to set skins. This can be done by setting `SkinWithoutPerm true` or giving:

```
- skinsrestorer.command
    - skinsrestorer.command.set
```

wip skinfile / skinsystem

### All skins

To allow all the skins, you simply need to give the players `/skin <skin>` permission. This can be done by turning on

### Disallow some skins

To disable specific skins only, you can add the names in the `DisabledSkins` configuration option.

Below is an example of blocking xknat & mclive:

(make sure to set Enabled: **true** in order to work)

```
DisabledSkins:
  Enabled: true
  Names:
    - xknat
    - mclive
```

If you wish to give special players the ability to set the disabled skins, you can do so by giving them
the `skinsrestorer.bypassdisabled` permission.

### Only selective skin

wip PerSkinPermissions: true & `skinsrestorer.skin.<skin>`

### Only their own skin

wip PerSkinPermissions: true & skinsrestorer.ownskin

### NO SKIN

SkinWithoutPerm: false

In this Module we will show you the basics of using SkinsRestorer in your server. We will talk about the different
futures SkinsRestorer can provide for your server.

1. Configure the `/plugins/SkinsRestorer/config.yml` file the way you like.

Each server has its own preference, there are a lot of different configuration options that you can try out.

2. Custom messages

Make SkinsRestorer look like its part of your own server with messages.yml, where you can even use color codes as well
as a desired prefix.

3. Get rid of Steve

With the usage of Default Skins future, you can get rid of those noxious Steve skins, long live SkinsRestorer!
You can do that by adding a new line and typing in the username of the premium account's skin you want to use. If you
use multiple default skins, a random skin from that list will be picked for every new player.

```
DisabledSkins:
  Enabled: true
  Names:
  - aljaxus
  - mclive
```

## Admin guide

### Apply skin to all

Here are some steps you can use for events where you want to apply the skin to all users at once as well as for future players joining.

**Preparations:**

1. if you wish players can't change skin during the "event":
- Turn off skinswithoutperms in skinsrestorer config.yml and restart the server
- Use a permissions plugin like luckperms
- Give players `skinsrestorer.command.*` permission (or command specific, see [Who can change skins?](#who-can-change-skins))

2. generate the skin:
- Use `/sr <skinName> <skinUrl> [classic/slim]` to create a "static" event skin. OR edit a stored skin timestamp to 0 (3rd line).
This is tso the skin won't check for update

**During the event:**

3. backup player files (if you wish to rollback skins after event is over)
- Check if your using skinsrestorer with or without mysql in skinsrestorer config -> mysql.enabled
- with mysql: make a copy of the players table (plugins/skinsrestorer/players/)
- without mysql: copy the players folder

4. if you want newly joining players to have the "event" skin:
- Enable SkinsRestorer Defaultskins option for all players and use the generated event skin (see [Everyone](#all-players)).
- reload skinsrestorer using (/sr reload) for the config changes to take effect.

5. if you want players that have already changed their skin to have the "event" skin:
- Perform all steps from "STEP 4" above
- make sure & validate that you did "STEP 3" by backing up your player's selected skin
- Check if your using skinsrestorer with or without mysql in skinsrestorer config -> mysql.enabled
- with mysql: clear the skin row of the player table
- without mysql: empty player folder in (plugins/skinsrestorer/players/) [**Make sure to not remove the folder**]

6. change the skin of all online players:
- run `sr setskinall <skin>` from **console**
